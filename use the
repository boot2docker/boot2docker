If GPLv3 is added to this list, then CC BY-SA 4.0 will be deemed one-way compatible with GPLv3, which means that a person can adapt a CC BY-SA 4.0 licensed work and release the adapted version under the terms of GPLv3.</p> <p>Throughout the drafting process of both of these licenses, the FSF, with the help of the Software Freedom Law Center, provided feedback and suggestions to Creative Commons.

<![CDATA[
<p>In this edition, we conducted an email-based interview with Rainey Reitman, Activism Director for the <a href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>, about their new <a href="https://github.com/EFForg/actioncenter-mobile">EFF Alerts</a> mobile app.<br /> </p> <h2>What inspired EFF to create EFF Alerts?</h2> <p>Part of our advocacy efforts includes helping people who care passionately about civil liberties to influence decision makers. We might target a company like Apple, or President Obama, or the U.S. Congress when it's considering proposals that would undermine liberty. We promote these campaigns through social media and our blog, as well as through our mailing list.<br /> </p> <p>One problem we're facing is that people are becoming less receptive to email communications. Part of that is simply email overload (the number one reason people give us for choosing to unsubscribe), as well as email providers trying to block or hide "mass" mailings.<br /> </p> <p>But when Congress is about to act on a bad bill, we may have only days -- or in some cases only hours -- to rally a response. So we need a reliable non-email way for people to connect with us.<br /> </p> <p>That's why we came up with EFF Alerts -- a fast, simple way to get notified on your mobile device whenever digital rights need your help. The EFF Alerts community is basically a fast-response emergency service for speaking out against imminent threats to our freedom.<br /> </p> <h2>Do you have to be in the United States to use the app?</h2> <p>Not all all; people all over the world should download the app. Many of our actions are international. However, sometimes we'll be organizing an action specifically targeting the United States Congress (because it is taking up a bill, for example). In those cases, it might not be possible for people outside the United States to complete the action, but there will be future actions they can take.<br /> </p> <h2>How can people use it?</h2> <p>Currently, people who want to install the app will get notified about breaking issues and actions through a push notification. People can click on the notification to load a mobile version of the EFF action center. Then they can take action -- often emailing Congress, signing a petition, sending a tweet, etc. To make this easy, you can set up a login and password on the EFF action center. That will retain your information and make it easier to speak out in the future.<br /> </p> <h2>Where can people get EFF Alerts?</h2> <p>People can download EFF Alerts from the Play Store. We're working on getting EFF Alerts onto F-Droid, but there are a few technical hurdles we have to jump through. We also have a version we put on our <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/12/download-eff-mobile-app">blog</a> that you can download if you don't want to use the store, but the Play Store ensures you get automatic updates with new versions,
